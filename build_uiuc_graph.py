"""
Hardcoded UIUC campus street-intersection graph with minimal attributes.

This version uses a fixed set of real intersections around the UIUC campus core
(bounded approximately by Springfield Ave (N), Gregory Dr (S), Wright St (W),
and Lincoln Ave (E)). All node attributes are set to 1, and all edge weights
are set to 1. No Gaussian risk models, hotspots, or coverage â€” just a simple
unweighted grid-like graph of major campus streets.
